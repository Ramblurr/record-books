## What?

I wanted my family to record themselves reading some of my child's favorite
books. We are scattered all over the world, so this makes it difficult. Not to
mention my family has all sorts of different devices and tech-skill levels.

This app allows a family member to load up a PDF (embeded in the webpage!) and
record themselves reading it. The resulting audio is saved back to the server,
where I can edit it and put it on my child's audio player.

I can send them a special URL which loads up the audio recorder and book in one
pane. They click record, start reading, click save.

Easy peasy.
